# matlab-faceBlends
Database of blended male faces from the Chicago Face Database, along with code for blurring images:

This is a bank of stimuli we created by blending together different male Caucasian and African-American faces from the Chicago Face Database (http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/index.html).  Models are blended to 4 different levels:  1-face (no blend), 2-face, 4-face, or 8-face.

There's also a short MATLAB script included that does an adaptive Gaussian blur to the faces (this was an attempt to control for morphing artifacts, where more blur is introduced with the more faces blended together).

For more info on the MATLAB code and/or image permissions, email Evan Carr at carr324@gmail.com.
